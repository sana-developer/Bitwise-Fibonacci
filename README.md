# Bitwise-Fibonacci
# LeetCode Learnings

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges and concepts that I've been working on as part of my journey to improve my programming skills. Below, you'll find a brief description of the files included in this repository.

## Table of Contents
- [Concepts Covered](#concepts-covered)
- [File Descriptions](#file-descriptions)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Concepts Covered
- **Bitwise Operators**: Understanding how to manipulate data at the bit level using AND, OR, NOT, and XOR operations.
- **Shift Operators**: Learning about left and right shift operations for bit manipulation.
- **Pre/Post Increment/Decrement Operators**: Exploring how increment and decrement operations work in programming.
- **Control Flow**: Using `break` and `continue` statements in loops.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Implementing the Fibonacci series using loops.

## File Descriptions
- `bitwiseOperator.cpp`: Implementation of various bitwise operations.
- `LeftRight_Shift.cpp`: Demonstrates left and right shift operations.
- `PrePost_IncDec_Operators.cpp`: Shows the use of pre and post increment/decrement operators.
- `BreakContinue.cpp`: Examples of using `break` and `continue` statements in loops.
- `fibonacci_series.cpp`: Solution for generating Fibonacci series.
  
Executable files (e.g., `.exe`) are also included for quick testing.

## Getting Started
To run the code, clone the repository and compile the `.cpp` files using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:

```bash
g++ bitwiseOperator.cpp -o bitwiseOperator
./bitwiseOperator
Feel free to explore and learn from my code. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
